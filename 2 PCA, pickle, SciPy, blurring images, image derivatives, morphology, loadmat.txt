1. Principle Component Analysis of image
	about PCA
		useful for dimensionality reduction 
		the principal components are obtained by the eigendecomposition of the covaraince matrix of the data
			and then project the data onto the eigenvectors
				the projection matrix resulting from PCA can be seen as a change of coordinates to a coordinate system where the coordinates are in descending order of importance
			the first feature is the one with most variance, and thus the most interesting one
			by comparing the first N (e.g. 50) eigenvectors, the dimensionality of the feature space is greatly reduced
		another way to understand PCA
			it tries to reduce the dimensionality by finding a linear subspace of the original feature space
				onto which we can project our data such that the projection error is minimized
	to use
		# the images need to be converted to a one-dimensional vector representation, and then be collected in a signle matrix, one row for each image
		def pca(X):
		    """ Principle Component Analysis 
			input: X, matrix with training data stored as flattened arrays in rows
			return: projection matrix (with important dimensions first), variance and mean. """
		    num_data, dim = X.shape
		    
		    mean_X = X.mean(axis=0)
		    X = X - mean_X
		    
		    if dim > num_data:          # PCA, compact trick used
			M = dot(X, X.T)         # covariance matrix
			e, EV = linalg.eigh(M)  # eigenvalues and eigenvectors
			tmp = dot(X.T, EV).T    # this is the compact trick
			V = tmp[::-1]           # reverse since last eigenvalues are the ones we want
			S = sqrt(e)[::-1]       # reverse since eigenvalues are in increasing order
			for i in range(V.shape[1]):
			    V[:, i] /= S
		    else:                       # PCA, SVD used
			U,S,V = linalg.svd(X)
			V = V[:num_data]        # only makes sense to return the first num_data
		    
		    return V,S,mean_X           # return the projection matrix, the variance and the mean

2. reading and saving files
	pickle
		# open file and save
		with open('font_pca_modes.pkl', 'wb') as f:	# it's best to read and write binary files
		  pickle.dump(immean,f)
		  pickle.dump(V,f)
		# open file and load
		with open('font_pca_modes.pkl', 'rb') as f:	# with statement, which automatically handles opening and closing files
		  immean = pickle.load(f)			# first in first out
		  V = pickle.load(f)
	NumPy's simple functions for reading and writing text files, if no complicated structures contained
		savetxt('test.txt',x,'%i')
		x = loadtxt('test.txt')

3. SciPy
	builds on NumPy and provides efficient routines for numerical integration, optimization, statistics, signal processing and image processing
	blurring images
		# from scipy.ndimage import filters
		# for graylevel image
			im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg').convert('L'))
			im2 = filters.gaussian_filter(im,5)			# 5 is the standard deviation, the bigger, the blurrer
		# for color images
			im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg'))
			im2 = zeros(im.shape)			# you cannot operate directly on the original array, so you create a new one
			for i in range(3):
			  im2[:,:,i] = filters.gaussian_filter(im[:,:,i],5)	# apply to each color channel
			im2 = uint8(im2)

	image derivatives (show the intensity changes over the image)
		# compute derivatives using Sobel or Prewitt filters
			# from scipy.ndimage import filters
			im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg').convert('L'))

			imx = zeros(im.shape)
			filters.sobel(im,1,imx)		# the second argument selects the x or y derivative, and the third stores the output	
			imy = zeros(im.shape)
			filters.sobel(im,0,imy)

			magnitude = sqrt(imx**2+imy**2)	# the gradient magnitude

		# using Guassian derivative filter, which is more robust to noise, and can compute derivatives at any scale
			sigma = 5			# standard deviation, the bigger, the blurrer

			imx = zeros(im.shape)
			filters.gaussian_filter(im, (sigma,sigma), (0,1), imx)
			imy = zeros(im.shape)
			filters.gaussian_filter(im, (sigma,sigma), (1,0), imy)

	morphology --counting objects
		# morphology is used for measuring and analyzing basic shapes, often applied to binary images, sometimes grayscale as well
			# from scipy.ndimage import measurements,morphology
			im = array(Image.open('houses.png').convert('L'))
			im = 1*(im<128)					# threshold to make sure it is binary

			labels, nbr_objects = measurements.label(im)	# nbr_objects is the count of objects
		opening
			# there may be some small connections between some of the objects, to remove them, we use binary opening
			im_open = morphology.binary_opening(im,ones((9,5)),iterations=2)
				# the second argument is the structuring element
				# ones((9,5)) means we use 9 pixels in the y direction (4 above and 4 below), and 5 in the x direction
				# only those pixels satisfy this structuring element will be preserved
				# the third argument determines how many times to apply the operation
	modules for I/O
		# scipy.io
			data = io.loadmat('test.mat')	# load a Matlab file, returning a dictionary with keys corresponding to the variable names saved in the .mat file

			data = {'x':x}
			io.savemat('test.mat', data)	# write to .mat file
		# scipy.misc
			misc.imsave('test.jpg', im)	# save the array as a image file
